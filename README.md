# BasicMesh
This package aims to generate uniform meshes for user defined shapes. At this moment in time the package can develop meshes for rectangles and circles, and can uniformly refine down meshes, shown below: <br>

This project is inspired by the much more sophisticated library for MATLAB, [iFem](https://github.com/lyc102/ifem), written by Long Chen, a professor I had the privelege of having when taking a PDEs class at UC Irvine. <br>
